## Society6 Backend Coding Exercise
Thank you for taking the time to do our Society6 coding exercise! 

### Getting Started
 - This coding exercise requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you don't have it already, or it might be out of date, please install/update it before proceeding.
 - Next, simply run `make install` and this will install all requirements. This step takes 10-20 minutes, depending on your machine.
 - If you are on Mac or Linux, you will be prompted to add a hosts entry for the purpose of this exercise. If you have Windows, please [follow these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/) to add the following entry: `127.0.0.1 society6.localhost`
 - Then navigate to http://society6.localhost:8080/ in your browser. You should see the homepage of the coding exercise.
 
### Console
If you would like to execute anything from the console, please run `make console` from the root of this project.

### Issues?
